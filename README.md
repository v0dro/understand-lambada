# understand-lambada

Repo with code for gaining a deeper understanding of the LAMBADA dataset. The accompanying blog post for this repo -- that explains everything and has lots of benchmarks -- can be found [here]().

Please log into your hugging face account using the [hugging face CLI](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/en/guides/cli) and request access for [Llama3.2-1B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B) in order to smoothly run all the tests in this repo.

This code is a step-by-step walkthrough for inference and fine tuning with LAMBADA. A summary of the files in this repo is as follows:
